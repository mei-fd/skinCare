"Description": "Our community sadly lost an important member on November 11th, Samuel Hoffman was the heart and soul of the community and volunteered at local charities and helped with community events. They will leave a big gap in our community and will be sorely missed. They were a beautiful person who spread joy and happiness wherever they went. The funeral will be a private ceremony with only close family members present. We invite you to make a donation in Samuel's name, in place of sending flowers to an organization he's passionate about and dedicated so much of their time to.",
